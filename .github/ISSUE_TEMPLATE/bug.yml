      description: >-
        Very important to understand the problem, enable logging for `plugwise` in `configuration.yaml` by adding:

        ```
        logger:
          default: warn
          logs:
            custom_components.plugwise: debug
            plugwise.smile: debug
        ```

        After adding this, restart HA Core.

        After the restart has finished please look in the supervisor **Core** logs (follow the below link and select 'Core' from the dropdown).

        [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the supervisor logs.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_logs.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_logs/)

        There should be several lines related to `plugwise-beta`. Please show us the **complete** log-message that starts this:

        ```[custom_components.plugwise] Data: PlugwiseData(gateway={'smile_name': ...```
