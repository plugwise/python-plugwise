- Two classes have been added (entities.py), one for master_thermostats and one for binary_sensors, these classes now handle the processing of data previously done in plugwise-beta (climate.py and binary_sensor.py).

## 0.9.4 - Bugfix and improvements

- Stick: make stick code run at python 3.9 (fixes AttributeError: 'Thread' object has no attribute 'isAlive')

## 0.9.2 - Smile: optimize

- Functions not called by the plugwise(-beta) code have been moved to helper.py in which they are part of the subclass SmileHelper
- All for-loops are now executed only once, the results are stored in self-parameters.
